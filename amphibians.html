                    The Central Asian grey monitor lizard is one of the subspecies of the grey monitor lizard. The largest 
                    lizard of the fauna of Central Asia.
                    <br>
                    The largest subspecies of the gray monitor lizard. Large individuals can reach a length of 1.5 m (of 
                    which about 60 cm falls on the body length and 90 cm on the tail) and weights up to 3-3.5 kg. But 
                    most adult monitor lizards are significantly smaller. Males are usually longer than females (the largest 
                    male from Turkmenistan, included in the sample in 1981, had a length of 58.5 cm without tail, and 
                    the largest female reached only 46 cm in length without tail), but not much heavier than them (the 
                    heaviest male weighed in this sample had a weight of 2,850 g, while the female - 2,700 g)
                    The Central Asian grey monitor lizard is widespread in Central Asia, Azerbaijan, Pakistan, Turkey, Iran 
                    and Afghanistan. The northern border of the range reaches the coast of the Aral Sea and the southern 
                    chinks of Ustyurt and generally coincides with the border of the southern deserts. In the west, the area 
                    is limited to the coast of the Caspian Sea. In the east, along the Syr Darya Valley, the gray monitor 
                    lizard penetrates into the Fergana Valley (where it is now extremely rare or disappeared), and along the 
                    Amu Darya Valley, its range reaches southwestern Tajikistan

                    The Siberian frog is a species of the family of true frogs. <br>
                    The back is grayish or gray-brown with small dark spots. The belly is white or white-yellowish with large irregular partially 
                    merged blood-red spots. Red spots may alternate with dark spots, and a red pattern on 
                    the abdomen begins to form around the second year of life. Males differ from females 
                    in the presence of a dark mating callus on the first finger. The head is moderately sharp. The 
                    lower leg is 1.75â€”2.4 times shorter than the body. The fingers are connected by webbing. 
                    The pupil is horizontal. The back of the tongue is free and forked.
                    This frog lives in western and eastern Siberia, the Far East of Russia, Korea, northern and central 
                    Mongolia, and northeastern China. The population density over a large area reaches several hundred and thousands of individuals per 
                    hectare. At the same time, in the northernmost and southernmost areas of the range, the species 
                    forms dense but small groups in suitable places, and in this case the total number should be 
                    considered low.

                <p class="information">
                    The Semirechensk frog-tooth is a tailed amphibian from the family of anglerfish 
                    (Hynobiidae). The species is allocated to the monotypic genus frogtooth (Latin Ranodon). It 
                    is endemic to the Dzungarian Alatau (Central Asia). A very rare endangered species. It is 
                    listed in the IUCN Red List as an endangered species due to the reduction of its range to less 
                    than 500 km2, on which it is distributed extremely sporadically, the continuing decrease 
                    in the number of suitable habitats, the decrease in the number of subpopulations and the 
                    number of mature individuals.
                    The total length of the body is 15-18 cm (up to 20 cm is indicated), of which the tail occupies a little more 
                    than half. Body weight about 20-25 g. There are 11-13 intercostal grooves on each side of the body. The tail 
                    is laterally compressed and has a well-developed fin fold on the dorsal side. The color ranges from yellowbrown to dark olive and greenish-gray, often spotted, varies depending on environmental conditions.
                    It is distributed only in the mountains of the Dzungarian Alatau within southeastern Kazakhstan and 
                    northwestern China. It lives mainly in small mountain streams and springs, forming small lakes, with a rocky 
                    bottom, fast current and waterfalls.
