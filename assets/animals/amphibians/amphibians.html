                        The Central Asian grey monitor lizard is one of the subspecies of the grey monitor lizard. <br>
                        The largest lizard of the fauna of Central Asia.
                        The largest subspecies of the gray monitor lizard. Large individuals can reach a length of 1.5 m (of 
                        which about 60 cm falls on the body length and 90 cm on the tail) and weights up to 3-3.5 kg. But 
                        most adult monitor lizards are significantly smaller. Males are usually longer than females (the largest 
                        male from Turkmenistan, included in the sample in 1981, had a length of 58.5 cm without tail, and 
                        the largest female reached only 46 cm in length without tail), but not much heavier than them (the 
                        heaviest male weighed in this sample had a weight of 2,850 g, while the female - 2,700 g)
                        The Central Asian grey monitor lizard is widespread in Central Asia, Azerbaijan, Pakistan, Turkey, Iran 
                        and Afghanistan. The northern border of the range reaches the coast of the Aral Sea and the southern 
                        chinks of Ustyurt and generally coincides with the border of the southern deserts. In the west, the area 
                        is limited to the coast of the Caspian Sea. In the east, along the Syr Darya Valley, the gray monitor 
                        lizard penetrates into the Fergana Valley.

                        The Siberian frog is a species of the family of true frogs. <br>
                        The back is grayish or gray-brown with small dark spots. The belly is white or white-yellowish with large irregular partially 
                        merged blood-red spots. Red spots may alternate with dark spots, and a red pattern on 
                        the abdomen begins to form around the second year of life. Males differ from females 
                        in the presence of a dark mating callus on the first finger. The head is moderately sharp. The 
                        lower leg is 1.75â€”2.4 times shorter than the body. The fingers are connected by webbing. 
                        The pupil is horizontal. The back of the tongue is free and forked.
                        This frog lives in western and eastern Siberia, the Far East of Russia, Korea, northern and central 
                        Mongolia, and northeastern China. The population density over a large area reaches several hundred and thousands of individuals per 
                        hectare. At the same time, in the northernmost and southernmost areas of the range, the species 
                        forms dense but small groups in suitable places, and in this case the total number should be 
                        considered low.

                    <p class="information">
                        The Semirechensk frog-tooth is a tailed amphibian from the family of anglerfish (Hynobiidae). <br> 
                        The species is allocated to the monotypic genus frogtooth (Latin Ranodon). It 
                        is endemic to the Dzungarian Alatau (Central Asia). A very rare endangered species. It is 
                        listed in the IUCN Red List as an endangered species due to the reduction of its range to less 
                        than 500 km2, on which it is distributed extremely sporadically, the continuing decrease 
                        in the number of suitable habitats, the decrease in the number of subpopulations and the 
                        number of mature individuals.
                        The total length of the body is 15-18 cm (up to 20 cm is indicated), of which the tail occupies a little more 
                        than half. Body weight about 20-25 g. There are 11-13 intercostal grooves on each side of the body. The tail 
                        is laterally compressed and has a well-developed fin fold on the dorsal side. The color ranges from yellowbrown to dark olive and greenish-gray, often spotted, varies depending on environmental conditions.
                        It is distributed only in the mountains of the Dzungarian Alatau within southeastern Kazakhstan and 
                        northwestern China. It lives mainly in small mountain streams and springs, forming small lakes, with a rocky 
                        bottom, fast current and waterfalls.
