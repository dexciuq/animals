                        Saiga is an artiodactyl mammal from the subfamily of true antelopes. 
                    A relatively small artiodactyl animal, body length 110-146 cm, tail 8-12 cm, height at the withers 
                    60-79 cm. Weight 23-40 kg. Elongated torso on thin, relatively short legs. The nose in the form of 
                    a soft, swollen, mobile proboscis with rounded, close-knit nostrils creates the effect of a 
                    "hunchbacked muzzle". Ears with a rounded top. The middle hooves are larger than the lateral 
                    ones. Only males have horns. They are approximately equal in length to the length of 
                    the head and on average reach 30 cm, translucent, yellowish-white, irregular lyreshaped, two-thirds from below have transverse 
                    annular rollers, located on the head almost vertically.
                    The belly is whitish. Its eyes are pale green or grey in color. Its muzzle is short and 
                    its forehead domed. Its nasal cavities are large. The fur is thick with hairs between 5 and 12 cm (2.0 and 4.7 in) long. 
                    Its body is stocky, short-legged, and slightly smaller than the other cats of the genus Panthera, reaching a 
                    shoulder height of 56 cm (22 in), and ranging in head to body size from 75 to 150 cm (30 to 59 in). Its tail 
                    is 80 to 105 cm (31 to 41 in) long.
                    Summer fur is yellowish-red, darker along the midline of the back and gradually lightening towards the belly, 
                    without a tail "mirror", low and relatively rare. Winter fur is much taller and thicker, very light, clay-gray. Molts 
                    twice a year: in spring and autumn.

                        The brown bear, or common bear, is a mammal of the bear family, 
                    one of the largest terrestrial predators.
                    The brown bear is a forest animal. Its usual habitats in Russia are 
                    solid woodlands with windbreak and burning with a dense growth 
                    of hardwoods, shrubs and grasses; it can enter both tundra and 
                    high-altitude forests. In Europe, it prefers mountain forests; in 
                    North America, it is more common in open areas â€” in the tundra, 
                    in alpine meadows and on the coast.
                    The average weight and body length of bears in Kamchatka were 
                    268.7 kg and 216.7 cm for adult males (older than 7 years) and 
                    174.9 kg and 194.5 cm for adult females, respectively, which is 
                    higher than in other regions of Eurasia (except, perhaps, Primorye, 
                    where it is believed that brown bears reach similar sizes.
                    The belly is whitish. Its eyes are pale green or grey in color. Its muzzle is short and 
                    its forehead domed. Its nasal cavities are large. The fur is thick with hairs between 5 and 12 cm (2.0 and 4.7 in) long. 
                    Its body is stocky, short-legged, and slightly smaller than the other cats of the genus Panthera, reaching a 
                    shoulder height of 56 cm (22 in), and ranging in head to body size from 75 to 150 cm (30 to 59 in). Its tail 
                    is 80 to 105 cm (31 to 41 in) long.

                    <p class="information">
                        The snow leopard (Panthera uncia), also known as the ounce, is a felid in the genus Panthera native to the 
                    mountain ranges of Central and South Asia. It is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List because the global 
                    population is estimated to number fewer than 10,000 mature individuals and is expected to decline about 
                    10% by 2040. It is threatened by poaching and habitat destruction following infrastructural developments. It 
                    inhabits alpine and subalpine zones at elevations from 3,000 to 4,500 m (9,800 to 14,800 ft), ranging from 
                    eastern Afghanistan, the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau, to southern Siberia, Mongolia and western China. 
                    In the northern part of its range, it also lives at lower elevations.
                    Taxonomically, the snow leopard was long classified in the monotypic genus Uncia. Since phylogenetic studies 
                    revealed the relationships among Panthera species, it has been considered a member of that genus. Two 
                    subspecies were described based on morphological differences, but genetic differences between the two have 
                    not been confirmed. It is therefore regarded as a monotypic species.
                    The snow leopard's fur is whitish to grey with black spots on head and neck, with larger rosettes on the back,
                    flanks and bushy tail. The belly is whitish. Its eyes are pale green or grey in color. Its muzzle is short and 
                    its forehead domed. Its nasal cavities are large. The fur is thick with hairs between 5 and 12 cm (2.0 and 4.7 in) long. 
                    Its body is stocky, short-legged, and slightly smaller than the other cats of the genus Panthera, reaching a 
                    shoulder height of 56 cm (22 in), and ranging in head to body size from 75 to 150 cm (30 to 59 in). Its tail 
                    is 80 to 105 cm (31 to 41 in) long.
