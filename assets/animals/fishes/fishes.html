                        The Caspian lamprey is a species of lamprey native to the Caspian Sea, and a member of the Petromyzontidae family. 
                    The Caspian lamprey is a slim-bodied, eel-like fish that grows to a length of about 40 cm (16 in). The longest 
                    recorded specimen was 55 cm (22 in) long and weighed 206 g. Like other lampreys, it has no jaws, but it has 
                    a round oral disc surrounding the mouth. Inside this it has several radiating rows of tiny, backward-facing 
                    teeth. There is a single nostril near the eyes. There are no gill covers and the seven gill openings are visible 
                    just behind the head. The fish has no scales or paired fins, but has two elongated dorsal fins, the hindmost of 
                    which nearly joins onto the small tail fin. The Caspian lamprey is a silvery-grey colour.
                    The Caspian lamprey is an anadromous fish which spends its adult life in the Caspian Sea and migrates 
                    up the Volga, Sura, and other rivers to spawn. It was at one time a common fish caught in nets and fish 
                    traps in the lower Volga for extracting fish oil and making candles and later for human consumption. In 
                    the early 1900s, 15 to 30 million fish were harvested annually from the lower Volga. It is now an 
                    uncommon fish because its migratory routes have been disrupted by dams and construction projects 
                    and it can no longer reach its spawning grounds.

                    beetles, 52-72 in their lateral ones, 12-17 on the abdominal ones. There are 21-40 (24-36) gill stamens on

                        The Siberian sturgeon is a species of sturgeon in the family Acipenseridae. It is most present in all of the major 
                    Siberian river basins that drain northward into the Kara, Laptev and East Siberian Seas, including the Ob, 
                    Yenisei (which drains Lake Baikal via the Angara River) Lena, and Kolyma Rivers. It is also found in Kazakhstan 
                    and China in the Irtysh River, a major tributary of the Ob. The species epithet honors the German Russian 
                    biologist Karl Ernst von Baer.
                    Siberian sturgeon usually weigh about 65 kg, with considerable variability between and within river basins. The 
                    maximum recorded weight was 210 kg. As with all other acipenserids, the Siberian sturgeon are long-lived (up 
                    to 60 years), and late to reach sexual maturity (males at 11–24 years, females at 20–28 years). They spawn in 
                    strong current main stem river channels over stone or gravel substrates. The Siberian sturgeon feeds on a 
                    variety of benthic organisms, such as crustaceans and chironomid larvae.
